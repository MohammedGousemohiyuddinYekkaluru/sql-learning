   1. Solve an SQL Task
=================================================================================

In my SQL Server database, we have two tables:
The first table is `orders` with the following columns: order_id, sales, customer_id, product_id.
The second table is `customers` with the following columns: customer_id, first_name, last_name, country.
Do the following:
	- Write a query to rank customers based on their sales.
	- The result should include the customer's customer_id, full name, country, total sales, and their rank.
	- Include comments but avoid commenting on obvious parts.
	- Write three different versions of the query to achieve this task.
	- Evaluate and explain which version is best in terms of readability and performance

   2. Improve the Readability
=================================================================================

The following SQL Server query is long and hard to understand. 
Do the following:
	- Improve its readability.
	- Remove any redundancy in the query and consolidate it.
	- Include comments but avoid commenting on obvious parts.	
	- Explain each improvement to understand the reasoning behind it.
