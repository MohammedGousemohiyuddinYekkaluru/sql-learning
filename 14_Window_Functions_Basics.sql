   SQL Window Functions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   SQL window functions enable advanced calculations across sets of rows 
   related to the current row without resorting to complex subqueries or joins.
   This script demonstrates the fundamentals and key clauses of window functions,
   including the OVER, PARTITION, ORDER, and FRAME clauses, as well as common rules 
   and a GROUP BY use case.
